# Game: Tic-Tac-Toe
I developed a tic tac toe game in R programming to allow users to play against a computer using the command line. This allowed me to develop basic skills in R programming. The code is error proof and allows users to try again after an incorrect input. 

Please begin playing by using using 'Rscript tic-tac-toe.R' on your command line.
